# React Authentication System

A lightweight authentication system built with React and React Router DOM, using a JSON Server–based self-made API. The project demonstrates a complete client-side authentication flow without any backend or database, focusing on routing, form handling, and controlled state management.

## 🔑 React Router Hooks Used

### useSearchParams()

Used to read and update query parameters in the URL. This helps manage conditional navigation, redirects, and URL-driven state changes.

### useActionData()

Used to access data returned from route `action` functions after form submission. This enables clean form workflows without manual state propagation.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. User registers through the Register API.
2. Login validates credentials against stored user data.
3. Logged-in status is maintained using API flags and client logic.
4. Protected routes restrict access based on authentication state.
5. Logout updates session status without server-side authentication.
6. Profile edits directly sync with the API.
